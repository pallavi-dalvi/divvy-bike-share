# divvy-bike-share

Aim:

Some organizations donâ€™t have dedicated business intelligence tools and Data Analyst will have to do data analysis using Excel, SQL, and the sheer power of intellect and will.
In this project, I will perform descriptive and geospatial analysis on the data provided for US City - Chicago under Divvy Bikes.
This is achieved by running SQL queries, downloading the results into Excel and doing analysis in Excel as well.

Introduction

A bicycle-sharing system, public bicycle scheme, is a service in which bicycles are made available for shared use to individuals on a short-term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" and return it at another dock belonging to the same system. Docks are special bike racks that lock the bike, and only release it by computer control. The user enters payment information, and the computer unlocks a bike. The user returns the bike by placing it in the dock, which locks it in place.
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles.
Data is present in Postgres DB.
